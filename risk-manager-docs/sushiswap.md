# Stablecoin TVL Monitoring with SushiSwap Subgraph

We retrieve daily liquidity data for stablecoin pools on SushiSwap using The Graphâ€™s public subgraph API.

Monitoring stablecoin TVL (Total Value Locked) across decentralized exchanges like SushiSwap helps detect early liquidity stress signals.

## API Endpoint

**Endpoint**:
```bash
https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/sushiswap/exchange
```

**Authentication:**
None required.

## Example Query (GraphQL)

```graphql
{
  pairDayDatas(
    first: 1,
    orderBy: date,
    orderDirection: desc,
    where: { pairAddress: "PAIR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS" }
  ) {
    date
    reserveUSD
    dailyVolumeUSD
  }
}
```

## Fields Monitored

**Field**	       **Purpose**
- reserveUSD	   Current liquidity (TVL) in USD
- dailyVolumeUSD   Daily trading volume (optional secondary signal)

## Example Response (truncated)

```json
{
  "data": {
    "pairDayDatas": [
      {
        "date": 1714003200,
        "reserveUSD": "78000000.00",
        "dailyVolumeUSD": "3200000.00"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- date is in UNIX timestamp format.
- reserveUSD provides the USD liquidity of the pool.
- dailyVolumeUSD gives daily trading volume (optional signal).

## Monitoring Criteria

- **TVL Drop Flag:**
Pools are flagged if liquidity (reserveUSD) drops by more than 10% within 24 hours.

- **Volume Spike Flag (optional):**
Pools are flagged if dailyVolumeUSD is over 2x the 7-day moving average.

## Rate Limits and Notes

- No hard limits, but recommended to query once daily.
- Data updates are typically near-real-time (a few minutes delay).
- Stablecoin pools monitored include:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; USDC/DAI
