The text below documents how to retrieve daily liquidity metrics, stablecoin dominance statistics, and yield opportunities from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) using free public APIs.

We currently support data access from:

Each API provides different data points. Please refer to the individual pages for detailed instructions and examples.
