At Stablecraft, we do more than connect APIs â€” we help you build a stablecoin payment infrastructure that fits your business model.

Whether you're a direct-to-consumer (D2C) brand, a SaaS company, or a decentralized application, we make it easy to:

- **Integrate real-time stablecoin payments**
- **Manage wallets securely and efficiently**
- **Navigate gateway setups like Coinbase Commerce and Stripe Crypto**
- **Explore on-chain checkout options when full Web3 integration is needed**

Our documentation provides an overview of the tools, payment flows, and providers we support.

It also explains how we set up integrations, manage credentials securely, and recommend best practices for handling stablecoin transactions.

**Our goal is to provide you with a fast, secure, and scalable foundation for stablecoin payments without the complexity.**
