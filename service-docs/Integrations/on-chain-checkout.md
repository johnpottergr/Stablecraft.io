# On-Chain Checkout Setup

If you prefer full Web3 control over your payments, we offer on-chain checkout integration.

An on-chain checkout flow allows your customers to send stablecoins (such as **USDC**, **DAI**, or **USDT**) directly to a smart contract or wallet address that you control ‚Äî without relying on third-party payment processors like Coinbase Commerce or Stripe.

---

## üöÄ How On-Chain Checkout Works

1. **Customer Initiates Payment**
   They connect their Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect) to your site.

2. **Transaction Sent to Blockchain**
   Customers approve and send a stablecoin payment directly to your receiving address or smart contract.

3. **Confirmation**
   The payment confirmation happens on-chain, visible through blockchain explorers (e.g., Etherscan).

4. **Optional: Smart Contract Logic**
   You can build custom smart contracts to handle additional logic:
   - Auto-releasing goods/services after payment
   - Issuing receipts (NFTs or otherwise)
   - Handling refunds under conditions

---

## üß© Requirements

- A deployed smart contract OR a verified stablecoin-receiving wallet.
- A front-end integration using Web3 libraries like [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) or [wagmi.sh](https://wagmi.sh/).
- (Optional) A backend server to monitor payment confirmations if automation is needed.

## ‚ú® Advantages of On-Chain Checkout

- **No Middlemen**: Full ownership and transparency over transactions.
- **Lower Fees**: Avoid traditional processor fees (only pay gas fees).
- **Programmability**: Customize the payment flow as needed.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Consider

- Customers must have a funded Web3 wallet.
- Gas fees may apply depending on the blockchain used.
- Smart contract development and audits are recommended for complex payment flows.
