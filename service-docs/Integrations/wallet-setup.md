# Wallet Setup & Management

Stablecoin payments require a reliable, secure wallet infrastructure — for both your business and your customers.

At Stablecraft, we guide you through the wallet setup process based on your needs, whether you prioritize ease of use, full asset control, or enterprise-grade security.

## 🧩 Types of Wallets We Support

### 🔐 Custodial Wallets

- Wallets managed by a trusted third party (like an exchange or payment provider).
- You rely on the provider to store private keys securely.
- Easier onboarding and recovery for businesses with less Web3 experience.
- Good examples: Coinbase Custody, Fireblocks, institutional-grade custodians.

### 🗝 Non-Custodial Wallets

- Wallets where **you** control the private keys directly.
- Full ownership over funds without relying on intermediaries.
- Increased security, but also increased responsibility (backup and recovery needed).
- Good examples: MetaMask, Ledger hardware wallets, smart contract wallets.
