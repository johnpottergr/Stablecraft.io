It\u2019s a fundamental part of how stablecoins operate\u2014because in order for users to send or hold stablecoins, those tokens first have to be issued somewhere. But unlike traditional currencies, stablecoins are minted on the blockchain, often through a smart contract or a permissioned issuing process.","sidebar":"kbSidebar"},"stablecoin-mechanics/peg-adjustment-logic":{"id":"stablecoin-mechanics/peg-adjustment-logic","title":"Peg Adjustment Logic","description":"At the heart of every stablecoin is a promise: that 1 token","sidebar":"kbSidebar"},"stablecoin-mechanics/smart-contract-risks":{"id":"stablecoin-mechanics/smart-contract-risks","title":"Smart Contract Risks","description":"Many stablecoins\u2014especially decentralized ones like DAI or algorithmic tokens\u2014depend on smart contracts to manage minting, burning, collateralization, and peg stability. These contracts are often pitched as \u201ctrustless\u201d or \u201cautomated,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re risk-free.
