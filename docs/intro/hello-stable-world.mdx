Stablecoins are the foundation of digital payments on our platform. Whether you're sending, receiving, or integrating payments into your application, stablecoins offer a reliable way to move value without volatility.

Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a consistent value—typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. That makes them a practical tool for transactions, invoicing, and cross-border payments where predictability matters.

### What you can do with stablecoins
Once incorporated, stablecoins can be used to:

- Settle payments instantly without relying on banks or traditional rails
- Fund or withdraw from wallets across supported chains and tokens
- Integrate with gateways for merchant transactions and invoicing
- Send peer-to-peer payments or payouts globally with low fees
- Enable on-chain pricing for services, subscriptions, or metered billing

Stablecoins are supported across multiple blockchains and networks, giving you flexibility to choose the best setup for your workflow.

### Before you start
Here are a few things to keep in mind as you begin working with stablecoins:

**1. Choose the Right Stablecoin**
We support a range of stablecoins, including fiat-backed (like USDC, USDT) and crypto-collateralized options (like DAI). Each has different backing mechanisms and risk profiles. You’ll find supported tokens and networks listed in your wallet dashboard or API reference.

**2. Understand the Network**
Stablecoins exist on multiple blockchains—Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and others. Make sure your wallet, payment gateway, or integration is using the correct network. Transferring tokens to an incompatible address can result in permanent loss.

**3. Keep an Eye on the Peg**
Stablecoins are meant to hold their value, but depegging events can happen. Stick with widely used, regularly audited tokens and monitor their backing if you're handling large or ongoing payments.
