Once your wallet is set up and funded, you’re ready to start sending and receiving stablecoin payments. Whether you’re paying a freelancer, settling with a vendor, or accepting customer payments, the process is quick—but there are a few things to double-check before clicking "Send."

### Sending a stablecoin payment

Sending stablecoins is similar to sending a bank transfer or PayPal payment—but it’s often faster, cheaper, and doesn’t rely on bank hours.

**1. Enter the Recipient’s Wallet Address**

This is usually a long alphanumeric string (e.g., 0x23ab...) or a human-readable name using services like ENS. Always double-check the address—there are no refunds for sending to the wrong one.

**2. Select the Correct Network**

Stablecoins can live on multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, etc.). Sending USDC on Ethereum to a Solana wallet won’t work. Make sure both sender and receiver are using the same token on the same network.

**3. Choose the Token and Amount**

Most wallets let you pick from supported assets in a dropdown. Select the correct stablecoin (e.g., USDC, USDT, DAI) and enter the amount to send.

**4. Review Fees**

You’ll see a network or “gas” fee before confirming. This fee varies based on network activity and is paid in the native token of the chain (e.g., ETH on Ethereum, MATIC on Polygon). Make sure you have a small amount of the native token in your wallet to cover the fee.

**5. Confirm and Send**

Once you approve the transaction, it’s broadcast to the network and usually confirms within seconds to a few minutes. You’ll see a transaction hash you can use to track its progress.

### Receiving a stablecoin payment
Receiving payments is simple once your wallet is set up.

**1. Share Your Wallet Address**

You can copy your wallet address from your wallet dashboard and send it to whoever is paying you. Some wallets also let you generate a QR code or share a payment request link.

**2. Confirm Network Compatibility**

Let the sender know which blockchain your wallet supports for that specific stablecoin. For example, receiving USDC on Polygon requires a Polygon-compatible wallet address.

**3. Wait for Confirmation**

Once the sender confirms the payment, you’ll typically see the funds appear in your wallet within a few minutes. Some wallets show a "pending" status until the transaction is finalized.

### Common pitfalls to avoid
- **Wrong network: This is the #1 issue. USDT on Tron is not the same as USDT on Ethereum. Always confirm both sides are using the same chain.
- **Not enough gas:** Sending requires a small amount of the native token for the fee (e.g., ETH, MATIC, SOL). Without it, your transaction won’t go through.
- **Fake or unverified tokens:** Make sure the stablecoin you’re interacting with is the verified version. Some wallets may display lookalikes—double-check the token contract address.
- **Clipboard malware:** If you’re copying and pasting wallet addresses, consider verifying the pasted address matches what you intended. Malware can quietly replace it.

### What about transaction reversals?
Blockchain transactions are final once confirmed. There’s no "undo" button—so triple-check recipient addresses, token types, and networks before sending. For higher-risk transactions, consider sending a small test amount first.
