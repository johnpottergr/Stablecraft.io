Using stablecoins comes with fewer middlemen, faster payments, and greater flexibility—but it also puts more responsibility in your hands. Unlike traditional payment systems, there’s no "undo" button or customer support line to reverse a blockchain transaction. That makes security habits especially important.

Here are key safety tips to help you protect your wallet, funds, and users.

### 1. Protect Your private keys and seed phrases
If you’re using a self-custodial wallet (like MetaMask, Rabby, or Trust Wallet), your private key or seed phrase is the only way to recover access. If someone else gets it, they can drain your wallet. If you lose it, your funds are gone.

**Best practices:**
- **Write down your seed phrase** and store it offline (never on your phone or cloud storage)
- **Never share it with anyone**, even if they claim to be support
- **Use a hardware wallet** for large balances or long-term storage

### 2. Double-check addresses and networks
Stablecoins can exist on multiple chains (USDC on Ethereum ≠ USDC on Solana). Sending to the wrong address or wrong network may result in permanent loss.

**Best practices:**
- **Verify the wallet address** carefully—especially when copying and pasting
- **Confirm the network** (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon) before sending
- **Use a test transaction** if you’re sending a large amount or to a new recipient

Some malware can replace copied wallet addresses with a fake one—always recheck what you've pasted before confirming.

### 3. Watch out for fake tokens and contracts
Some wallets will let you import any token address—this flexibility can be dangerous. Scammers often create fake versions of popular stablecoins with nearly identical names or symbols.

**Best practices:**
- **Verify token contracts** through the issuer or a trusted block explorer
- **Avoid tokens shared via unsolicited DMs** or unknown websites
- **Use official links when adding stablecoins to your wallet** interface

### 4. Use 2FA and strong passwords (for custodial wallets)
If you're using a custodial wallet (hosted on a platform like Coinbase), protect your login the same way you would a bank account.

**Best practices:**
- **Enable two-factor authentication** (2FA)
- **Use a strong, unique password** stored in a password manager
- **Monitor for suspicious activity**—many platforms offer alerts or login history

### 5. Avoid phishing links
Scammers often impersonate wallet interfaces, exchanges, or support teams. A single click can expose your wallet.

**Best practices:**
- **Bookmark official sites** and avoid clicking links in emails or messages
- **Be skeptical of pop-ups** asking you to “reconnect” your wallet
- **Always verify the site URL**—typos or subtle changes are a red flag

### 6. Use reputable tools and platforms
Whether you're using a wallet, bridge, payment processor, or dApp—stick with tools that have been vetted, audited, or recommended by trusted sources.

If you're building an integration, check for security features like rate limits, transaction signing controls, and webhook verification.

### Final thoughts
Using stablecoins safely is mostly about awareness and consistency. Take a few simple steps up front—like securing your seed phrase and double-checking addresses—and you'll reduce the risk of errors or loss.
