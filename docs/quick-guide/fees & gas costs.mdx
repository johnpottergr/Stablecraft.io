When sending or receiving stablecoin payments, you may encounter a few types of fees. These are usually lower than traditional payment processing fees, but they’re still important to understand—especially if you're managing multiple transactions, integrating a wallet, or working across blockchains.
This guide breaks down the most common types of fees you’ll run into and how to plan around them.

### 1. Network (Gas) fees

Every blockchain charges a fee to process transactions—this is known as a network fee or gas fee. It pays the validators or nodes that confirm and secure your transaction.

**Key points:**

- Fees are paid in the native token of the blockchain, not the stablecoin itself.
For instance, Ethereum fees are paid in ETH, Polygon fees are paid in MATIC, and Solana fees are paid in SOL.
- Fee amounts vary based on network congestion. During busy periods, fees go up.
- Wallets usually estimate fees for you before you confirm the transaction. Example:
Sending 50 USDC on Ethereum might cost $2–$10 in ETH during peak hours. On Polygon, it might cost just a few cents in MATIC.

### 2. Exchange or conversion fees
If you're swapping another token (e.g., ETH) into a stablecoin, or vice versa, the platform you're using may charge a conversion fee. This is separate from the blockchain fee and is often a small percentage of the total.

**Tips:**
- Check the fee percentage before confirming a swap.
- Compare rates across platforms if you're doing large conversions.
-  or payment services bake this fee into the displayed exchange rate.

### 3. Service or platform fees
Some payment providers, wallets, or gateways may charge an additional fee for processing stablecoin payments—especially for features like:
- Fiat on/off ramps (converting stablecoins to USD or vice versa)
- Batch payments or invoicing tools
- Instant settlement or guaranteed delivery

These fees are typically flat-rate or volume-based and may be listed in your transaction summary or billing section.

### 4. Bridging fees (when changing networks)
If you need to move your stablecoins from one blockchain to another—for example, from Ethereum to Arbitrum—you’ll use a bridge. Bridging often involves:
- A network fee on the source chain
- A fee from the bridge provider
- A waiting period for final settlement

Bridging is useful but can be more expensive and slower than regular transfers, so use it when necessary and plan ahead.

### Reducing fees
Here are a few ways to keep fees low:

- **Use low-fee networks** like Polygon, Solana, or Avalanche for everyday transfers
- **Avoid peak hours**—fees often drop outside of U.S. and European business hours
- **Consolidate transactions** instead of sending many small ones
- **Keep native tokens in your wallet** to cover network fees smoothly

### Final thoughts
Stablecoin payments are efficient, but understanding fees helps you avoid surprises—especially when transacting at scale or integrating with your app.
