Welcome! If you're new to using stablecoins for payments, you're in the right place. This short guide walks you through the first steps—what you’ll need, how it works, and what to expect.

### What you'll need
Before you start sending or receiving payments with stablecoins, make sure you have the following:

- **A digital wallet** that supports the stablecoin(s) and network(s) you plan to use
- **Access to the supported blockchain networks** (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana)
- **Some funds in the wallet**, either stablecoins or crypto to swap into them
- **Your recipient's wallet address**, if you’re sending a payment
- **Basic understanding of transaction fees** (we’ll cover that in a separate guide)

If you're building an integration, you may also need access to our API or SDK—check our developer documentation for setup instructions.

### Why use stablecoins?
Stablecoins let you move value fast, 24/7, without the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies. They're particularly useful for:

- Settling payments across borders
- Paying freelancers or vendors in digital-native economies
- Sending peer-to-peer payments with minimal delay
- Integrating on-chain pricing into your app or service

And because stablecoins stay pegged to fiat currencies (usually the U.S. dollar), they feel more familiar to use in everyday payment flows.

### Basic flow
Here’s what the stablecoin payment process generally looks like:

**1. Set up your wallet**
Install a wallet app or browser extension, or use a custodial service if you prefer. You'll find detailed instructions in our Setting up a Wallet section.

**2. Acquire stablecoins**
You can receive them from another wallet, buy them through a crypto exchange, or swap another asset (like ETH or SOL) directly in your wallet.

**3. Send or receive a payment**
All you need is the recipient's wallet address and the correct token + network selected. The transaction usually settles in seconds or minutes.

**4. Track confirmations**
Blockchain transactions are transparent—your wallet will show when the payment is confirmed.

**5. Store, spend, or convert**
Once received, stablecoins can be held, used to pay others, or swapped back into other assets as needed.
