Stablecoins aren’t just for online stores—they can also be used to accept fast, low-cost payments in person. Whether you operate a storefront, food truck, event booth, or mobile service, connecting stablecoin payments to your point-of-sale (POS) system can simplify checkout and broaden your payment options.
The discussion below explains how to set up stablecoin payments for in-person transactions using QR codes, mobile wallets, or POS integrations.

### How stablecoin payments work in-person
Unlike credit card terminals that rely on banks and payment processors, stablecoin payments use blockchain wallets. Instead of swiping a card, the customer scans a QR code or taps a button in their wallet app to send funds directly to your business wallet.

Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain—usually within a few seconds—the payment is complete. No chargebacks, no intermediaries, and no weekend or holiday delays.

### POS integration options
#### 1. QR code-based checkout
The simplest setup involves generating a QR code at checkout that represents:

- The stablecoin amount
- Your wallet address
- The correct blockchain network (e.g., Polygon, Solana)

You can display this code on a tablet, phone, or printed receipt. Customers scan the QR code with their crypto wallet app and approve the payment. This method works well for fixed-price transactions and is ideal for small businesses, pop-ups, or vendors who want a low-maintenance solution.

#### 2. POS app or plugin integration
Some POS platforms support stablecoin payments through third-party plugins or wallet integrations. These apps can:

- Calculate fiat-to-stablecoin conversions in real time
- Display dynamic QR codes for each transaction
- Monitor blockchain confirmations and update the POS system automatically

Reserve this option for merchants who already use iPad or Android-based POS systems and want to streamline the checkout experience without building a custom solution.

#### 3. Custom API integration
If you’re building your own POS or payment system, you can connect directly to a stablecoin payment provider’s API. This gives you control over how payments are generated, tracked, and confirmed, and allows you to link receipts, customer IDs, and loyalty systems.

You’ll need to handle wallet generation, transaction monitoring, and network selection, or rely on a turnkey SDK to manage the technical details.

### Considerations for in-person payments
- **Network speed and fees:** Choose a blockchain that supports fast, low-cost transactions—Polygon, Solana, and Tron are common picks for point-of-sale payments.
- **Payment confirmation:** Most blockchains confirm transactions within seconds, but be prepared for occasional delays during periods of high congestion. Some systems allow for visual indicators like “pending” or “confirmed” status on your POS screen.
- **Stablecoin selection:** Stick to widely recognized and stable assets like USDC or USDT. Be clear with customers about which token and network you accept.
- **Fallback options:** If a customer’s wallet doesn’t support the network you use, consider having a backup QR code ready or educating staff on how to guide the customer through a swap if needed.

### Final thoughts
Connecting stablecoin payments to your POS system gives your business the flexibility to accept digital payments in a fast, borderless way—without relying on banks or traditional processors. Whether you're accepting crypto-savvy customers or experimenting with alternative payment rails, stablecoins offer a simple, direct option for in-person commerce.
