After accepting stablecoin payments, many businesses eventually want to convert those digital funds into local currency—whether to pay vendors, cover expenses, or move money into traditional bank accounts. The good news is: it’s a well-established process, and there are multiple ways to do it.
Listed below are your main options for cashing out, what to expect in terms of fees and timing, and how to choose the right approach for your business.

### How to convert stablecoins to fiat
There are three main ways to convert stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) into fiat currency (like USD, EUR, or GBP):

#### 1. Use a centralized exchange (CEX)
The most common route is a CEX. You send your stablecoins to an exchange account, trade them for fiat, and withdraw to your business bank account.

Popular exchanges for this include:

- Coinbase (U.S., Europe)
- Binance (global)
- Kraken (U.S., Europe)
- Bitstamp (Europe)

**Steps:**

- Transfer stablecoins from your wallet to the exchange
- Convert to fiat (either manually or using an auto-sell option)
- Link your business bank account and withdraw funds

**Typical timeline:** 1–3 business days for withdrawal, depending on the exchange and your bank.

#### 2. Use an on-ramp/off-ramp provider
Some platforms specialize in fiat conversion without the need for a full exchange account. These providers often integrate directly with your wallet or payment flow and support faster withdrawals to bank accounts, debit cards, or even PayPal.

Common services:

- MoonPay
- Ramp
- Banxa
- Transak

**Best for:** Merchants who want to automate conversions or offer cash-out functionality to users directly from a platform.

#### 3. Withdraw via a payment processor or stablecoin identicalssuer
If you’re using a provider like Circle (issuer of USDC), you may have access to treasury services that allow direct cash-outs from your USDC balance to a bank account—often with faster processing and fewer steps than a public exchange.

**Note:** These options are generally available to verified business accounts and may have higher minimums or KYC requirements.

### Key considerations
**Fees:** Conversion and withdrawal fees vary by method:
- CEXs typically charge a small percentage per trade and may have flat withdrawal fees
- On-ramp/off-ramp services may include conversion spreads in addition to fixed fees
- Bank transfer fees (especially international wires) can also apply

**Speed:** Stablecoin-to-fiat conversions are generally fast, but fiat withdrawals can take longer depending on your bank. Some services offer instant or same-day withdrawals for an extra fee.

**Compliance and limits:** Most platforms will require identity verification and may impose limits on how much you can withdraw daily or monthly. Make sure your business profile is fully verified to avoid delays.

**Accounting:** Always document the amount converted and the fiat value at the time of transfer. This helps with tax reporting and reconciliation later. See our Stablecoin Accounting page for more on how to record these transactions.

### Final thoughts
Cashing out stablecoins into fiat is easier than ever—whether you're managing business finances, settling invoices, or simply moving funds into your operating account. Choose the method that fits your volume, speed, and compliance needs, and keep good records as you go.
