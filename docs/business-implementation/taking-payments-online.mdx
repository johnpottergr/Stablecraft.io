Accepting stablecoins online opens up a faster, borderless way to do business—with fewer payment failures and lower transaction costs than traditional methods. Whether you’re running an e-commerce store, a SaaS platform, or a service-based business, integrating stablecoin payments is often simpler than you’d expect. The guide below walks through your main options and what to keep in mind when setting up your online payment flow.

### Accepting stablecoins on your website
There are a few ways to accept stablecoins directly through your site:

**1. Hosted checkout / no-code solutions**

Some platforms offer a simple, branded checkout page where customers can pay with stablecoins. You can embed it via a button or redirect link—no custom development required. This is ideal for small businesses or teams looking to get started quickly without writing code.

**2. Plugins and e-commerce integrations**

If you're using Shopify, WooCommerce, or another e-commerce platform, you may be able to install a plugin that connects to a stablecoin payment provider. These usually handle network selection, QR code generation, and wallet compatibility on your behalf.

**3. Custom integration via API**

For larger platforms or SaaS products, integrating stablecoin payments via API offers more control. You can:
- Generate payment requests tied to invoices or user IDs
- Track incoming payments by wallet address or transaction hash
- Trigger webhooks for order fulfillment after successful confirmation

You’ll need to handle wallet address generation, network selection, and confirmation logic—or use a payment provider’s SDK to simplify that process.

### Key things to consider
**Supported networks and tokens**

Decide which stablecoins (e.g., USDC, USDT, DAI) and blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana) you want to support. The combination affects transaction fees, wallet compatibility, and user experience. Supporting L2 networks like Arbitrum or Polygon can significantly reduce cost per transaction.

**User experience**

- Your payment flow should clearly show:
- The amount in fiat and stablecoin terms
- The wallet address or QR code for payment
- The network being used (and a warning if it must match)
- A confirmation or order status page once the payment is detected

**Payment confirmations**

Most blockchains confirm transactions in seconds or minutes, but you should account for delays or failed payments. A best practice is to wait for 1–3 block confirmations before marking a payment as complete.

**Refunds and reversals**

Unlike credit cards, blockchain payments are irreversible. If a refund is required, it must be initiated manually. Consider building a refund flow that logs original payment addresses and lets you reissue funds in case of cancellations or disputes.

### Compliance and reporting
Even when dealing with digital assets, your business may still be subject to local regulations around invoicing, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML). Be sure to:

- Record the stablecoin received and its fiat equivalent at the time of payment
- Collect customer details if required by your jurisdiction
- Work with a compliance or accounting advisor if handling large volumes or international payments

### Final thoughts
Taking stablecoin payments online can reduce overhead, open up global markets, and simplify settlement—but it’s important to plan the user experience and technical implementation around the needs of your business.
