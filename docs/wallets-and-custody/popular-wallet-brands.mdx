Choosing the right wallet brand can make a big difference in how your business handles stablecoins. Some wallets are optimized for convenience, others for advanced control or team access. While all of them store and manage digital assets, their features—and trust levels—vary. Here,
we introduce some of the most widely used wallet brands, with notes on where they work best and what makes them stand out.

### MetaMask
MetaMask is one of the most recognized wallets in crypto. Originally built as a browser extension, it now also has a mobile app and supports most Ethereum-compatible networks, including Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism. It’s especially popular for interacting with DeFi apps and accepting stablecoin payments through Web3 checkout flows.

While MetaMask is self-custodial and user-friendly, it’s primarily designed for individual use. Businesses can use it for light activity, but it lacks built-in multi-user access or approval workflows. For many companies, MetaMask works best as an operational wallet or interface for developers.

### Trust Wallet
Trust Wallet is a mobile-first, multi-chain wallet owned by Binance. It supports a broad range of blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and more. It’s ideal for businesses that want an easy way to manage stablecoins across several chains from a single app.

Trust Wallet is fully self-custodial and easy to use, but like MetaMask, it doesn’t have enterprise features like access controls or multisig. It’s a solid option for small teams or contractors who need secure, simple access on mobile devices.

### Rabby
Rabby is a browser-based wallet created by DeBank, known for being more secure and multi-network–aware than MetaMask. One of its standout features is that it automatically detects the correct blockchain based on the dApp you’re using—helpful for teams working across multiple chains.

It’s a great choice for developers or power users who need precision and real-time network switching. Rabby also supports hardware wallets, making it a good operational wallet for stablecoin activity tied to smart contracts or APIs.

### Gnosis Safe
Gnosis Safe is the gold standard for multisig wallets. It lets teams set up wallets that require multiple signers for any outgoing transaction—perfect for treasury management, enterprise operations, and added protection against internal or external threats.

Gnosis Safe supports most Ethereum-compatible networks and allows for highly customizable access policies, making it ideal for startups and DAOs that need to move beyond single-user wallets. It also integrates with popular tools like Ledger and Trezor for cold storage support.

### Ledger and Trezor
Ledger and Trezor are two of the most trusted hardware wallets, providing cold storage for stablecoins and other assets. They’re used to keep private keys completely offline, which greatly reduces the risk of hacks or accidental exposure.

While these devices are less convenient for everyday transactions, they’re ideal for long-term storage or backing up high-value reserves. Both Ledger and Trezor support integrations with hot wallets like MetaMask or Rabby, allowing businesses to combine convenience with added security.

### Fireblocks (Enterprise)
For businesses at scale—especially exchanges, fintech apps, or institutional platforms—Fireblocks offers an enterprise-grade wallet and custody platform. It combines MPC (multi-party computation) security, role-based access controls, transaction policies, and integrations with banks and service providers.

Fireblocks is designed for teams that need rigorous oversight and automated controls for moving large amounts of stablecoins. It's not a wallet in the consumer sense, but more of a digital asset infrastructure solution for businesses managing custody at scale.

### Final thoughts
There’s no one-size-fits-all wallet brand. The best choice depends on how your business uses stablecoins—whether that’s receiving payments, making payouts, managing reserves, or integrating wallets into your platform. Many teams use a combination: one wallet for daily operations, another for team-controlled funds, and a third for secure cold storage.
