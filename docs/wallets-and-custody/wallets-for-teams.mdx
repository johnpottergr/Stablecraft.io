When a business grows beyond a single person, wallet management gets more complex. Teams need to send payments, track balances, and interact with integrations—but without relying on one individual’s device or private key. That’s where multi-user wallet setups come in.
The article below explains how businesses can securely manage stablecoin wallets with multiple team members involved.

### The problem with single-user wallets
Most basic wallets—like MetaMask or Trust Wallet—are designed for individual users. They rely on one device and one seed phrase, which means:

- There’s no way to give others controlled access
- There’s no protection against mistakes or theft
- If one person loses their keys, the whole wallet is compromised

Single wallets may work for freelancers or solo operators, but it breaks down quickly for businesses that need team-based access or separation of duties.

### Multi-user wallet solutions
There are a few ways to set up wallets for teams, depending on how much control and security you need.

#### 1. Multisig Wallets
Multisig (multi-signature) wallets require multiple people to approve transactions. For example, a 2-of-3 setup might require two out of three team members to approve any transfer.

Popular options:

- **Gnosis Safe** (Ethereum and compatible chains)
- **Safeheron**, **Kirobo**, or **MultiSafe** for more advanced setups

Multisig wallets are ideal for:

- Businesses with finance or treasury teams
- Joint custody of large reserves
- Internal controls and audit compliance

#### 2. Role-based wallet platforms
Some wallet providers offer enterprise tools where different users can be assigned roles (e.g., admin, viewer, sender) without sharing private keys.

These platforms often include:

- Team dashboards
- Approval workflows
- Transaction logs
- Support for stablecoins across multiple chains

Examples include **Fireblocks**, **Qredo**, and **Casa for Business**.

#### 3. Wallet-as-a-Service (WaaS)
If you're building your own app or platform and need to issue wallets to multiple users or team members, WaaS providers let you embed wallet functionality with built-in access controls and security features.

These are popular with:

- Fintech and DeFi apps
- Platforms offering crypto payments or rewards
- Companies managing wallets at scale

### Best practices for team wallets
- **Use separation of roles:** Don’t give full access to everyone. Use multisig or role-based controls to distribute responsibility.
- **Document access policies:** Keep track of who has access to what, and how transactions are approved.
- **Regularly review permissions:** As teams change, so should your wallet access list.
- **Back up keys securely:** Use secure, offline backups for any master keys involved in wallet setup or recovery.

### Final thoughts
Team wallets bring accountability and structure to stablecoin operations. Whether you're paying contractors, managing a treasury, or integrating crypto into your product, a well-designed wallet setup keeps your funds secure and your workflows efficient.
