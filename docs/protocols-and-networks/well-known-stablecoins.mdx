There are dozens of stablecoins in circulation, but only a handful are widely used in real-world payments, exchanges, and integrations. While they all aim to maintain a stable value—usually pegged to the U.S. dollar—the way they achieve that stability varies. Below are some of the most recognized and trusted stablecoins across crypto and payment ecosystems.

**USDC (USD Coin)** is one of the most widely used and regulated stablecoins, issued by Circle and backed 1:1 with cash and short-term U.S. Treasury assets. It’s fully transparent, with regular attestations, and is integrated across major networks including Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Arbitrum. Thanks to its reputation and regulatory posture, USDC is frequently used by payment platforms, fintech apps, and businesses looking for predictability and compliance.

**USDT (Tether)** is the oldest and most traded stablecoin by volume. It's backed by a mix of reserves, including commercial paper, secured loans, and government securities. While Tether’s transparency has been questioned in the past, it remains a dominant force, especially in global crypto markets where liquidity and multi-chain access matter more than regulation. USDT is supported across dozens of blockchains, making it a versatile but sometimes controversial choice.

**DAI** is a decentralized stablecoin issued by MakerDAO. Instead of being backed by fiat in a bank, DAI is overcollateralized with crypto assets like Ether and USDC. Smart contracts keep it close to $1 through automated incentives and liquidations. DAI appeals to users who value decentralization and on-chain transparency, though it can be more complex to integrate or explain to end users unfamiliar with DeFi mechanics.

**FRAX** is a partially collateralized, partially algorithmic stablecoin. Originally launched as a new take on algorithmic design, FRAX has since shifted toward a more conservative approach, with most of its value now backed by on-chain assets and real-world collateral. It represents a hybrid model that balances decentralization with risk management, and it’s finding a niche among advanced users and developers.

**TUSD (TrueUSD)** is another fiat-backed stablecoin that emphasizes transparency and regular third-party attestations. It’s often used in trading environments that prioritize regulatory clarity but want alternatives to USDC or USDT. While it’s not as widely integrated as USDC, it’s gaining traction in specific regions and platforms.

**GUSD (Gemini Dollar)** and **PAXG (Paxos Gold)** are also worth noting. GUSD is a fully regulated stablecoin issued by Gemini and often used by institutions. PAXG is a gold-backed token—each unit represents one fine troy ounce of gold held in a vault—which offers a different kind of “stability” tied to commodities rather than fiat.

While all of these tokens aim for price stability, their differences in transparency, collateral, governance, and network reach make them better suited to different use cases. For example, if you’re integrating stablecoins into a payments app for U.S. customers, USDC is often the most straightforward option.

If your users are trading across global markets or need multi-chain liquidity, USDT may be more accessible. And if your platform emphasizes decentralization, DAI or FRAX might be the better fit.

As the ecosystem matures, newer stablecoins may emerge that blend transparency, scalability, and regulatory readiness. But for now, these well-known options provide the foundation for most stablecoin-enabled payment flows.
