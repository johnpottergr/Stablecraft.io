One of the biggest advantages of stablecoins is the ability to send money quickly and often for much less than traditional payment systems. But the exact fee you’ll pay depends on which blockchain network you're using. Fees aren’t charged by stablecoin issuers—they’re charged by the network that processes the transaction.
Here's why why fees vary and gives you a sense of what to expect across common chains.

### Why network fees matter
Every time you send a stablecoin, the transaction needs to be confirmed by the blockchain. That confirmation process costs money—usually in the form of a “gas fee” or network fee, paid in the blockchain’s native currency. It’s not a fixed fee, and it can change depending on network demand.

For example:

- On Ethereum, fees are paid in ETH
- On Polygon, fees are paid in MATIC
- On Solana, they’re paid in SOL
- On Arbitrum, fees are still paid in ETH, but typically much lower than mainnet

These fees can influence which network you choose, especially if you're sending many small payments or working with fee-sensitive users.

### Typical fee ranges by network
Here’s a general overview of what you might expect to pay when sending stablecoins across different chains. These are estimates and can vary day to day.

| Network                 | Typical Fee Range (USD) | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ethereum (L1)**       | $2 – $20+                | High security and compatibility, but most expensive during peak times |
| **Polygon**             | $0.01 – $0.10           | Fast and low-cost, ideal for frequent payments                        |
| **Solana**              | $0.001 – $0.005         | Extremely low fees, great for real-time or microtransactions          |
| **Arbitrum**            | $0.02 – $0.50            | Much cheaper than Ethereum, still highly compatible                   |
| **Optimism**            | $0.05 – $0.70            | Similar to Arbitrum, with Ethereum-level functionality                |
| **Tron**                | $0.01                   | Very cheap and fast, popular for global stablecoin transfers          |
| **Avalanche (C-Chain)** | $0.10 – $0.30            | Competitive fees and fast settlement times                            |


### Tips for managing fees
- Check the current gas rate before sending—most wallets will show you the estimated cost in real time.
- Keep some of the network’s native token in your wallet to cover transaction costs.
- Use low-fee networks like Solana, Polygon, or Tron for frequent, small transactions.
- Batch payments when possible to reduce per-transaction overhead.
- Avoid sending during peak hours—fees on Ethereum, especially, can spike during market volatility or popular NFT drops.

### Choosing based on fee needs
If you're sending one-off payments and cost isn’t a concern, Ethereum offers familiarity and wide support. But if you're sending many transactions per day—or operating in regions where cost sensitivity matters—networks like Polygon, Solana, or Arbitrum are far more efficient.

And if you're integrating stablecoin payments into your app or business, choosing the right network can have a real impact on user experience and operating costs.
